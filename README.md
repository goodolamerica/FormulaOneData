# FormulaOneData
 Collection, transformation, analyzing data about Formula One

This is my first project using the SQL language. 
My main goals starting out with this project:
  1) Become familiar with SQL Server language
  2) Understand how to create and manipulate tables along with data types
  3) How to effectivley use primary and foreign keys (along with how to reference/create them)
  4) Merge tables to create historical data
  5) Create Views, CTEs, temp tables, etc.
  6) Manipulate/analyze data to find patterns or trends
  7) Extract data to create visuals via Tableau

When I started this project, I began by manually entering all 2024 data into the tables to become familiar with how data and SQL work together. After that process, I wanted to add historical data to have a more robust dataset to analyze for trends. I am still in this process ensuring I merge tables accurately without errors or disruptions when analyzing later.

If I started this project from scratch again, I know I would approach it slightly differently as each day I learn more than I knew the day before.
